# Autodock Vina example
This is an example of how to perform molecular docking simulations with
Autodock Vina in Galileo. The user must make a configuruation file,
called "conf.txt" that specifies the parameters of the simulation. 

Do not specify the 'cpu' parameter. Vina will detect the number of 
cpus available to it by default.
