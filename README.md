# FLO2D example
This is example comes from the FLO2D Diamond example that comes pre-installed with FLO2D software. 

To run FLO2D jobs with Galileo, you must supply a valid systemflP.dll file by placing
it in the top of your FLO2d project folder. Your systemflP.dll can typically be found in the 
C:\Program Files (x86)\FLO-2D PRO directory. Just copy and paste it into your project folder. 

If you would like to use a custom or specific FLOPRO.exe executable, you can place this in your Mission directory as well. Galileo will then automatically use this supplied 
executable for the simulation.
