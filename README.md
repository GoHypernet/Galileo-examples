# Galileo application example repository

This repository contains a number of examples, representing many frameworks,
that can be deployed through Galileo with no additional setup. 

Each subdirectory contains its own readme file describing the analysis being 
performed. A user can copy the Dockerfile from an example similar to the one 
they would like to run and modify it accordingly. Alternatively, a user can 
use the Docker Wizard helper in the Galileo application to build a Dockerfile 
from scratch for their framework.
