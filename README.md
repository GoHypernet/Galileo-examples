# Autodock Vina example
This is an example of how to perform molecular docking simulations with
Autodock Vina with Galileo. The User must make a configuruation file,
called "conf.txt" that specifies the parameters of the simulation. 

Leave the 'cpu' parameter blank as the default behavior is to run on as
many cpus as are available.
