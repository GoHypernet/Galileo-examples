# FLO2D example
This is example comes from the FLO2d installed Diamond example. 

To use FLO2D with galileo, you must supply a valid systemflP.dll file by placing
it in the top of your FLO2d project folder. 

If you would like to use a custom or specific FLOPRO.exe executable, you can place this at
the top of your project directory as well and Galileo will automatically use this supplied 
executable for the simulation.
