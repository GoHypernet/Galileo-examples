# MNIST Linear Classifier via Logistic Regression
This example trains a Linear Classifier using the MNIST 
dataset as training data. The singular value decomposition
is chosen as the numerical technique by which to perform the
regression itself.

The output is a score (recorded in the stdout) and a regression
model that is written to a file.
