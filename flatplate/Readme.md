# Solid mechanics simulation example
This example uses the open source AERO-S FEM solver to simulate the response of 
vibrating MEMs devices to an external load. 
The mesh, boundary conditions, and solver parameters are contained in the flatplate subdirectory. 
The simulation produces nodal displacement and velocity files as well as a timing and 
solver residuals file
