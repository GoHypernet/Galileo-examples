# Stata example 
This is a quick running example demonstrating the statistical software Stata. You need to supply a valid Stata16 license for it to run.

To do this, place your stata.lic file at the top level of your Galileo project folder.

On Mac, it is located at /Applications/Stata/stata.lic.

On Windows, it is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Stata16\STATA.LIC

On Linux, it is located at /usr/local/stata16/stata.lic
